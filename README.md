THE DATA
We will be using NBA stats from 2017, taking a 2 week period in which games were played.
The data is rich in in-game statistics such as field goals, free throws etc

HYPOTHESIS
1. Players less than 6ft7 tall have a higher 3-point percentage than those who are 6ft7 or taller. i.e. mu_short > mu_tall
2. On average, home teams score similarly to away teams. mu_home = mu_away
3. Guards have a higher free throw percentage than centres. mu_guard > mu_centre
4. Teams in the west conference, on average, score more than eastern conference teams. mu_west > mu_east
